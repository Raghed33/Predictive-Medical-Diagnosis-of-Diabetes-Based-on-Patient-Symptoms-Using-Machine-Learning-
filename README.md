# 🤖 Predictive Medical Diagnosis of Diabetes

## 📄 Description

This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence (ENCS3340) course. It focuses on predicting diabetes based on patient symptoms using machine learning models. The system was built using Python and Weka, leveraging different classification algorithms to analyze and diagnose diabetes.

## 🚀 Features

 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed medical datasets from Kaggle.

 Diabetes Classification: Applied multiple machine learning algorithms to classify diabetes cases.

 Model Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 Web Interface: Implemented a user-friendly interface for real-time diabetes diagnosis.

## Machine Learning Models:
